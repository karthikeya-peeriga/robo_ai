# robo_ai
Website made under contract for tech analogy's upcoming product called "Robo AI" 


# Tech stack used ->

-> Made the app using the "create-react-app"
-> Front end is pure react. (Scope for Next.js exists). No particular justification for react only. Used it because we can. 


# Wanna run it?

-> Clone this repository.
-> You'll need node and create-react-app library.
-> do "npm i"
-> do "npm start"
